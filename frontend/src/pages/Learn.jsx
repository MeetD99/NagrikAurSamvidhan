However, these freedoms can be limited by reasonable restrictions set by the State for reasons such as maintaining national security, public order, and moral standards.",

It allows for laws that may set residency requirements for certain jobs and permits reservations for backward classes to address underrepresentation in state services. This article aims to uphold fairness in employment while accommodating measures to support disadvantaged groups.",

This right is essential for the functioning of democracy, allowing for open discourse, criticism, and the exchange of diverse perspectives. While this freedom is fundamental, it is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of national security, public order, and morality. This provision empowers citizens to participate actively in the democratic process and fosters an informed and engaged society.",
